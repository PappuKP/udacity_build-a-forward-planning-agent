Project: Build a Forward-Planning Agent
<br>


The objective of this project is to build a forward planning agent that uses search and symbolic logic techniques to automatically develop and execute plans to achieve their goals.

This project is split between implementation and analysis. First we will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then we will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.
